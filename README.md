# PhD - Phase I: Do Benzodiazepines Cause AEs?

This is the repository for the first project (phase I) of my PhD. The question is "Do Benzodiazepines Cause AEs?"

The goal is to determine causality between benzodiazepines (BZDs) and several AEs: anxiety, depression, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, infections and pneumonia. The data source is the Canadian Longtiduinal Study on Aging (CLSA). Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) will be used to determine the variables to include in the generalized linear model to assess each of the outcomes.
